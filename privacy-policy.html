  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 December 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our
    mobile game application (the “App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information
    such as name, email address, phone number, precise location, or contacts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App is designed purely for entertainment and does not require user
    registration or login.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, a third-party advertising service
    provided by Google Inc., to display advertisements, including interstitial
    and rewarded ads.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google AdMob may collect non-personal information such as device information,
    advertising identifiers, and general usage data to serve ads. These ads are
    configured to be non-personalised and family-safe in compliance with the
    Google Play Families Policy and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
    (COPPA).

  <h2>3. Children’s Information</h2>
  <p>
    We are committed to protecting children’s privacy. The App is suitable for
    all ages and complies with the Google Play Families Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age
    of 13.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not collect personal data, there is no risk of personal data
    being stored or misused by us. Third-party services such as Google AdMob
    operate under their own privacy and security practices.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
    posted on this page with an updated revision date.
